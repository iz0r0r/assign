# Case Study

Run test.html to start the application

Assumptions 

1)Assumed 3 layers 
   1-->top-->contains letter ,
   2-->middle-->contains Name,
   3-->bottom-->contans letters
   
2) if  a letter is repeated number of times it size will be huge then its line from center goes below to other node

3) 20px radius incremented if letere is repeated
4) Assumed all other css like padding and margin
5) background color not altered as if we apply reandom colors it will detoriate the view .(i.e there can be cases where color interferes with text color)
  if need just add ( 'background':randomcolor() at line 32 in test.js
6)i assumed that this will be used in latest browsers hence used SVG to create line .
